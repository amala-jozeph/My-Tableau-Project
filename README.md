# Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard 🫀📊

A Tableau data visualization project analyzing heart disease patterns to identify high-risk groups and key medical indicators.

## 📌 Project Overview
This dashboard explores heart disease trends across age, gender, chest pain types, and vital health metrics. The goal is to support early risk identification using interactive visual analytics.

## 🎯 Objective
- Analyze heart disease distribution among patients  
- Identify age-wise and gender-wise trends  
- Study the impact of cholesterol, resting BP, and max heart rate  
- Highlight key risk factors for early diagnosis  

## 🗂 Dataset Overview
- **Total Records:** 918 patients  
- **Source:** Heart Disease Dataset (CSV)  
- **Key Columns Used:**  
  - Age  
  - Sex  
  - Chest Pain Type  
  - Cholesterol  
  - Resting Blood Pressure  
  - Max Heart Rate  
  - Heart Disease (Target Variable: 0 / 1)  

## 📊 Dashboard Components
- KPI Cards:
  - Total Patients  
  - Heart Disease Rate  
  - Average Cholesterol  
  - Average Max Heart Rate  
- Age-wise Bar Chart  
- Stacked Bar Chart (Chest Pain Type × Gender)  
- Gender Distribution Pie Chart  
- Line Chart (Heart Disease Count by Age)  
- Max Heart Rate Histogram  
- Scatter Plot (Resting BP vs Age)  
- Dual Axis Bar + Line Chart  

## 📈 Key Metrics
- **Total Patients:** 918  
- **Heart Disease Rate:** 55.3%  
- **Average Cholesterol:** 198.8 mg/dl  
- **Average Max Heart Rate:** 136.8 bpm  

## 🔍 Insights
- Over half the patients show signs of heart disease  
- Risk increases significantly after age 40  
- Highest cases observed in the 50–59 age group  
- Males represent 79% of heart disease cases  
- Common chest pain types:
  - Non-Anginal Pain (NAP)  
  - Atypical Angina (ATA)  
- Cholesterol and max heart rate values indicate moderate to high cardiac strain  
- Resting BP does not show a strong age-dependent pattern  

## 🧠 Major Findings
- Age 40+ is the highest-risk bracket  
- Men are significantly more affected than women  
- Chest pain type is a strong indicator of heart disease  
- Vital signs highlight cardiovascular stress across age groups  

## ✅ Conclusion
The dashboard effectively identifies high-risk populations using visual analytics. It can assist healthcare professionals in early screening, preventive care, and resource planning.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Tableau
